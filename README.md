# Data_Cleaning_using_Python_on_Excel
Data Cleaning Project
Objective:
This project focused on cleaning raw customer data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis. The process involved addressing missing values, correcting data types, standardizing categorical variables, and handling outliers.

Key Steps:

Handling Missing Values:

Imputed numerical data using statistical methods (e.g., mean, median).
Filled categorical values with the most frequent entry or placeholder.
Fixing Data Types:

Converted date fields to datetime format.
Validated numerical and categorical fields for consistency.
Standardizing Categorical Values:

Ensured uniform capitalization and fixed typos.
Merged duplicate categories for clarity.
Outlier Detection:

Applied statistical methods like Interquartile Range (IQR) and z-scores.
Treated outliers based on business context and data integrity needs.
Data Validation:

Ensured logical consistency across fields.
Checked for invalid or out-of-range entries.
Tools & Technologies Used:

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, and datetime for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
Techniques: Imputation, outlier detection, and category standardization.
Project Deliverables:

Cleaned customer data in Excel format.
Detailed data cleaning report documenting all steps and justifications.
Python code showcasing the data cleaning workflow.
